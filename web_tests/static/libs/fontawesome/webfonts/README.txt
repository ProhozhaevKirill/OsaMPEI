Font Awesome Web Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the actual font files:
- fa-solid-900.woff2
- fa-solid-900.woff
- fa-regular-400.woff2
- fa-regular-400.woff
- fa-brands-400.woff2
- fa-brands-400.woff

These files can be downloaded from the official Font Awesome releases at:
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases

For now, the CSS will fallback to system fonts for basic functionality.
